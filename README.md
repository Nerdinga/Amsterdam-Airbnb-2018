# Amsterdam-Airbnb-2018
Rental properties in Amsterdam

Data was sourced from Erik Bruin via Kaggle on July 8th, 2025 (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/erikbruin/airbnb-amsterdam). He created "all Airbnb listings in Amsterdam on December 6th, 2018", which includes 6 .csv files, entitled calendar, listings, listings_details, neighbourhoods, reviews, and reviews_details. The most important files for my project are calendar ("The calendar has 365 records for each listing. It specifies the whether the listing is available on a particular day (365 days ahead), and the price on that day") that contains dates and prices from 20'000 housing offers and listings that contains the geographical information for those houses.

There were no duplicates and in general this data seems to be of good quality. The main limitation is that it was collected in 2018, which is relatively old. This data is only from Amsterdam, so no global generalizations can be made. As no PPI is included and the dataset if freely available on Kaggle, there should be no privacy issues.

Questions for analysis
•	Which neighborhoods are the most expensive?
•	Do people who own multiple properties differ in their rental trends from solo homeowners?
•	Do prices vary as much for a rented room compared to a rented house/apartment?
•	Do people with very few reviews rent their properties cheaper?
•	Are properties with longer minimum nights are cheaper or more expensive compared to the properties available for 1 night?
